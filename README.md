My Data Analysis Portfolio—My journey with the Incubator Hub
# 👋 Hello! I'm Felix Oyekola
## 🎯 Multilingual Data Analyst | Excel • SQL • Power BI | Insight Translator and Interpreter (French|English|Yoruba)
Welcome to my portfolio!  
I'm Felix Oyekola, a multilingual data analyst fluent in English, French, and Yoruba, who transforms messy datasets into clear, actionable stories. Whether it’s building a pivot table in Excel, writing a multi-layered SQL query, or crafting a Power BI dashboard — I love helping people make decisions they can trust.
## 🌍 My Story
Before diving into data, I worked as a *language tutor, translator, and interpreter* — helping people connect across cultural and linguistic boundaries. Today, I bring that same clarity and context to the world of data.
Every number has a story. My job is to tell it.
#### During the Data Analysis Journey, I got equipped with well of knowledges using different tools:
### 1 SQL
## 💼 Work Experience
### PROJECT A 🟢 KMS Inventory SQL Case Study

📦 KMS Inventory SQL Case Study
Repository: KMS_Inventory_SQL_Case_Study
Author: Felix Oyekola | Multilingual Data Analyst (English • French • Yoruba)
📘 Overview
Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) is a retail and office supply company operating in multiple regions. This project explores their operational data from 2009 to 2012 to uncover patterns in:
Sales performance by category and geography
Customer segmentation and profitability
Shipping method efficiency and alignment with priority
The analysis was completed using SQL (SQL Server syntax) and supported by Excel for documentation and visualization.
## 🎯 Case Scenarios & Business Questions
### ✅ Case Scenario I: Sales & Shipping
- Which product category had the highest sales?
- What are the Top 3 and Bottom 3 regions in terms of sales?
- What were the total sales of appliances in Ontario?
- What should be done to increase revenue from the bottom 10 customers?
- Which shipping method incurred the most cost?
### ✅ Case Scenario II: Customer Insights
- Who are the most valuable customers, and what do they typically purchase?
- Which small business customer had the highest sales?
- Which corporate customer placed the most orders (2009–2012)?
- Which consumer customer was most profitable?
- Which customer returned items, and what segment do they belong to?
- Was shipping cost aligned with order priority?

As part of a business analytics case for a retail company, I conducted deep-dive SQL analysis across customer segments, sales regions, product categories, and shipping methods. I worked directly in *SQL Server*, wrote performance-optimized queries, and exported insights to Excel for review.
*Key Contributions:*
- Identified top and bottom performing customers and product categories
- Assessed shipping costs vs. order priorities
- Joined and filtered data across multiple dimensions (customer, time, geography)
- Wrote reusable SQL scripts, exported result sets, and documented the entire process
👉 You’ll find all scripts and analysis in the above Screenshot.
### 2 POWER BI 
🟡 Power BI – Palmoria HR Analytics  
*Role:* Power BI Analyst  
*Link:* [📁 View Dashboard – ](#)
Designed and developed an interactive *HR analytics dashboard* for a manufacturing firm. This project focused on *gender equity, **salary compliance, and **performance-based bonus allocation*.
*Dashboard Highlights:*
- Gender distribution across departments and regions
- Salary bands and minimum wage law compliance
- Bonus allocations based on performance ratings
- Use of slicers, custom visuals, and DAX formulas
This Power BI report helped senior leadership understand workforce gaps at a glance.

### 🔵 Excel Project: Amazon Product Review Analysis  
*Role:* Excel Analyst 
In this project, I used Excel to clean, analyze, and summarize customer review data from a simulated Amazon product dataset.
*What I Did:*
- Cleaned and transformed raw review data using functions like TEXT(), IFERROR(), VLOOKUP, and TRIM()
- Grouped reviews by rating and product category
- Created dynamic *PivotTables* to show high- and low-rated items
- Designed a simple visual dashboard using slicers and conditional formatting
This project showcases how Excel can be both analytical and visual when used right.
