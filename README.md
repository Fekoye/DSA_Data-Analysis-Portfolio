## 🌍 My Story
Before diving into data, I worked as a *language tutor, translator, and interpreter* — helping people connect across cultural and linguistic boundaries. Today, I bring that same clarity and context to the world of data.
Every number has a story. My job is to tell it.

As part of a business analytics case for a retail company, I conducted deep-dive SQL analysis across customer segments, sales regions, product categories, and shipping methods. I worked directly in *SQL Server*, wrote performance-optimized queries, and exported insights to Excel for review.

*Key Contributions:*
- Identified top and bottom performing customers and product categories
- Assessed shipping costs vs. order priorities
- Joined and filtered data across multiple dimensions (customer, time, geography)
- Wrote reusable SQL scripts, exported result sets, and documented the entire process

👉 You’ll find all scripts and analysis files once uploaded.
