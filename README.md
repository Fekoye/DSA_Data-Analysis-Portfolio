My Data Analysis Portfolio—My journey with the Incubator Hub
# 👋 Hello! I'm Felix Oyekola
## 🎯 Multilingual Data Analyst | Excel • SQL • Power BI | Insight Translator and Interpreter (French|English|Yoruba)
Welcome to my portfolio!  
I'm Felix Oyekola, a multilingual data analyst fluent in English, French, and Yoruba, who transforms messy datasets into clear, actionable stories. Whether it’s building a pivot table in Excel, writing a multi-layered SQL query, or crafting a Power BI dashboard — I love helping people make decisions they can trust.
## 🌍 My Story
Before diving into data, I worked as a *language tutor, translator, and interpreter* — helping people connect across cultural and linguistic boundaries. Today, I bring that same clarity and context to the world of data.
Every number has a story. My job is to tell it.

#### During the Data Analysis Journey, I got equipped with well of knowledges using different tools:
## 1 THE UNLEVELED PLANE OF SQL THAT I LATER LEVELED
Under this plane of knowledge called DSA Incubator, I wass equippped with the following knowledges and I got the the following experiences:
### 💼 Work Experience
#### PROJECT A 🟢 KMS Inventory SQL Case Study  
*Role:* Data Analyst (SQL + Excel)  
*Link:* [📁 View Responses and Queries:[KMS_Case_Study_Executed_Results_Felix O. Oyekola.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20970405/KMS_Case_Study_Executed_Results_Felix.O.Oyekola.xlsx)

📘Overview of Kultra Mega Stores (KMS)
Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) is a retail and office supply company operating in multiple regions. This project explores their operational data from 2009 to 2012 to uncover patterns in:
- Sales performance by category and geography
- Customer segmentation and profitability
- Shipping method efficiency and alignment with priority
(The analysis was completed using SQL (SQL Server syntax) and supported by Excel for documentation.)
## 🎯 Case Scenarios & Business Questions
### ✅ Case Scenario I: Sales & Shipping
- Which product category had the highest sales?
- What are the Top 3 and Bottom 3 regions in terms of sales?
- What were the total sales of appliances in Ontario?
- What should be done to increase revenue from the bottom 10 customers?
- Which shipping method incurred the most cost?
### ✅ Case Scenario II: Customer Insights
- Who are the most valuable customers, and what do they typically purchase?
- Which small business customer had the highest sales?
- Which corporate customer placed the most orders (2009–2012)?
- Which consumer customer was most profitable?
- Which customer returned items, and what segment do they belong to?
- Was shipping cost aligned with order priority?

### As part of a business analytics case for a retail company, I conducted deep-dive SQL analysis across customer segments, sales regions, product categories, and shipping methods. I worked directly in SQL Server, wrote performance-optimized queries, and exported insights to Excel for review.
*Key Contributions:*
- Identified top and bottom performing customers and product categories
- Assessed shipping costs vs. order priorities
- Joined and filtered data across multiple dimensions (customer, time, geography)
- Wrote reusable SQL scripts, exported result sets, and documented the entire process
👉 You’ll find all scripts and analysis in the above Screenshot.

### 💡 Strategic Recommendations to Management
1. 🎯 Segment and Retarget
- Send personalized promotions to low-revenue customers based on category
- Create discount bundles tied to minimum order values
2. 🚚 Set Free Shipping Thresholds
- Encourage larger orders by offering free delivery over ₦X value
3. 📦 Bundle Slow-Moving Inventory
- Offer value bundles including products commonly ordered by bottom 10
4. 📈 Limit Excessive Discounts
- Review if these customers receive high discounts with little ROI
- Replace with point-based reward systems
5. 📬 Follow-Up & Re-engagement
- Send surveys or emails to understand why these customers buy less
- Offer incentives to complete feedback

## 2 THE LEVELED PLANE OF POWER BI
This is the plane upon which I can say I fly
🟡 Power BI – Palmoria HR Analytics 
### 1. File for analysis: [Palmoria_HR_Analysis_Report-Felix Oyekola.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20970631/Palmoria_HR_Analysis_Report-Felix.Oyekola.xlsx)

I Designed and developed an interactive *HR analytics dashboard* for a manufacturing firm. This project focused on *gender equity, **salary compliance, and **performance-based bonus allocation*.

*Role:* Power BI Analyst  
📌 **Tools**: Power BI, Excel  
📌 **Focus**: Gender equality, salary compliance, bonus allocation  
📌 **What I Did**: (*Dashboard Highlights:*)
---
- Visualized gender distribution by region and department
- Highlighted performance ratings and salary gaps by gender
- Analyzed $90,000 minimum wage compliance
- Calculated bonuses and total compensation using DAX
📊 Interactive dashboard with slicers
### Files for Dashboard [📁 View Dashboard – [Palmoria files for Project submission DSA-Felix O. Oyekola.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20970589/Palmoria.files.for.Project.submission.DSA-Felix.O.Oyekola.pdf)](#)

## 3 THE RIGOROUS ROAD OF *EXCEL*
🔵 Excel Project: Amazon Product Review Analysis  
*Role:* Excel Analyst 
In this project, I used Excel to clean, analyze, and summarize customer review data from a simulated Amazon product dataset.
*What I Did:*
- Cleaned and transformed raw review data using functions like TEXT(), IFERROR(), VLOOKUP, and TRIM()
- Grouped reviews by rating and product category
- Created dynamic *PivotTables* to show high- and low-rated items
- Designed a simple visual dashboard using slicers and conditional formatting
This project showcases how Excel can be both analytical and visual when used right.
## 📁 Portfolio Highlights
